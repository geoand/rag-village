Can't pass multiple pojos to llm using AI service?

LLM's are kinda overprotective. Not fond of every orc personality

Imagebind would be the dream? => ImageBind: One Embedding Space To Bind Them All https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05665. Unfortunately my laptop can't run it.

Maybe use CLIP and MS CLAP?

Do i want to use Named Entity Recognition? NER -> https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/reader-generator-modules/ner-transformers

I am forced to embed things before sending them to databases with langchain4j. Meaning i cant leverage auto vectorization modules of vector db's

Ways to improve RAG:
    - GraphRAG
    - Model fine tuning

RAG as a name sucks, why not Cyborg Generation X (or CyborgGenX or CGX)

Probably need to use Llava for vision. Can i run vision and LLM models at the same time?
    - Doesnt seem to be possible. It stops the previous model whenever i switch
